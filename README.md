# Malware-Camouflage
This file documents the progress and reference of research conducted by Chou Yi Hung.
Nowadays, different stealth malwares conduct a myriad of camouflage techniques.
However, there are not enough database and anaysis for these malware.
On this situation, I collect the malwares from various database and examine them by mischellaneous tools.
## Basic-static analysis
### Tools
md5deep: calculate the unique hash ID of malware. Then, search the hash online to see if that malware has been anaylized. 
strings: list the strings in the execution file. We may find some useful information such as DLL, URL or even error messages.
PEiD: detect the type of packer or compiler which makes analying the packed file much easier.
