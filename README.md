# Malware-Camouflage
This file documents the progress and reference of research conducted by Chou Yi Hung. </br>
Nowadays, different stealth malware conduct a myriad of camouflage techniques.</br>
However, researchers lack the resources of malware analyses and databases.</br>
Therefore, I collect the malware on windows and android platform from various databases and examine them by miscellaneous tools.

# Research Direction
By analizing different malware across differnt time span, try to catalog the packing or comouflage technology changing in different time span.
## Basic-static analysis
### Tools
1. md5deep: calculate the unique hash ID of malware. Then, search the hash online to see if that malware has been analyzed. 
2. strings: list the strings in the execution file. We may find some useful information such as DLL, URL or even error messages.
3. PEiD: detect the type of packer or compiler which makes analyzing the packed file much easier.
4. Dependency Walker: could tell the DLLs used in the malware.
